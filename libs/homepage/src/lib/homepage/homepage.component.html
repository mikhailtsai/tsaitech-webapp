    <b>Frontend:</b><br />
    I worked for 4 years as a Senior Frontend Developer at a top fintech company in my home country, but left after moving out.<br />
    This is my best qualification: Angular/Typescript and "rxjs of the brain".<br /><br />

    <b>Tech experience:</b><br />
    I have practiced DDD for web applications, NX Monorepo, Module Federation, CI/CD (gitlab-ci), and NGINX configurations.<br /><br />

    <b>Backend:</b><br />
    Nest.js and Node.js are my preferred tools for backend development. <br />
    I always use TypeScript and work with various databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis.<br /><br />

    I have a strong understanding of microservices for backend development and "microfrontends" as well.

    I can understand and communicate well with speakers who have an average American accent. For other accents, I ask that you speak clearly and slowly, avoiding rapid streams of thoughts ;)
    <br /><br />
    I prefer direct and to-the-point conversations. I can read technical documents and make necessary changes. I expect the same level of skill from my management.
    <br /><br />
    <b>However, it's important to note</b> that discussing technical topics can be challenging, even in one's native language. Therefore, all discussions should have a written conclusion that everyone agrees upon.
    <br /><br />
    My main goal is to set positive expectations and meet them. Once I earn trust, I require less management, and you can always rely on me.

    I have experience managing a technical team consisting of 1 iOS developer, 1 Android developer, 1 backend developer, 2 web developers, and 1 QA. I successfully maintained team morale and performance, ensuring all members were motivated, stress-free, and felt both "motivated" and "protected".

    Legacy code

  <p class="tui-text_body-m text-max-width text-base">
    I've been programming since 2009 and know how different a codebase can be. I remain motivated working with legacy code only when the project strives to leave this legacy and strives to actually allocate a large percentage of tasks to correct this tech debt.
    <br /><br />
    <i>
      A little advice: <br />
      If you have legacy code and if this is a problem for you, then do not involve junior and middle level developers to this code.<br />
      Cheap improvements can turn out to be a very expensive legacy.
